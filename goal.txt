Stunning finish from the striker!
What an absolutely beautiful goal!
A terrible, terrible mistake by the keeper.
How has he done that?
The crowd are chanting his name, and it's well deserved after a goal like that.
Driven home with incredible power.
An incredible show of technique, the keeper was never going to get to that!
Huge blunder by the defence there! The manager will not be happy with that!
The manager's head is in his hands, and I don't blame him!
What an incredible shot! More than enough to etch his name into the history books!
