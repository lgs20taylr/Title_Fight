What an absolutely shocking miss!
He easily could've had that.
Perfect up until the finish!
Great save by the keeper there.
Good effort, but not enough power to drive it home.
Poor technique there from the striker.
Oh, what a miss!
He'll be devastated to have missed that one.
Tipped just wide by the keeper.
Safe hands from the keeper, it was never going to go in.
